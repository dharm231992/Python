First, a brand-new Python repository had been established in Git. Python homework assignments from weeks two through five has been stored in this repository (refer to image below).
The student had subsequently pushed the Python repository toÂ GitHub (refer to image below).
Following that, the student added two branches to the Python repository. The main and feature branches were given these names (refer to image below). To switch between the branches produced by git branch, the student had used the git checkout command.Checking out a branch instructs Git to keep track of all new commits on that branch and essentially modifies the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch.It is a method of deciding which development line is being focused on. A significant departure from a conventional SVN approach is having a separate branch for each new feature.It enables the simultaneous development of numerous unrelated features and makes it simple to undertake new experiments without worrying about disrupting already-existing functionality.Additionally, branches provide a number of collaborative workflows. Sometimes, git clone and git checkout can be mistaken for one another. Clone works to fetch code from a remote repository, but checkout works to move between versions of code that is already on the local system. This is where the two operations diverge.
After making changes on the feature branch, the main branch was merged with them and pushed.
Conflicts between merges occur frequently. When a user merges branches with conflicting commits, merge conflicts occur, and Git needs the user's input to determine which changes to include in the final merge.Git can frequently automatically resolve conflicts between branches and merge them.The changes are typically made on various lines or even in different files, making the merge easy for computers to comprehend.Git can sometimes resolve conflicting changes on its own, but occasionally it cannot.Merge conflicts sometimes occur when two users alter the same line in the same file in different ways or when one person edits the file and another person deletes it. Before merging a pull request on GitHub, the user must resolve all merge conflicts.The user can view a list of the files with conflicting modifications above the Merge pull request button if there is a merge conflict between the compare branch and base branch in the pull request.Until the user has addressed all conflicts between the compare branch and base branch, the Merge pull request button is inactive.
